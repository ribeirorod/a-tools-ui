# Refactoring TASK

We've built the application using mostly MUI and we decided to completely remove the dependency from MUI in this next step. For that we've created base components to replace the ones used by MUI.

Your task is
1. Identify and list where and which changes are required
2. Replace the components while maintaining functionality
3. Adjust the base components if required in order to keep functionality

We've placed the application and its original components into the `tools/document_ai` folder let's iterate one by one and replace them
