### Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Getting Started**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/artificial-tools/a-tools-ui.git`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Run the development server: `npm run dev`

2. **Project Structure**
   - `/src/common`: Shared components, hooks, and utilities
   - `/src/tools`: Individual AI tool components and logic
   - `/src/styles`: Global styles and theme configuration
   - `/src/tests`: Test files for components and tools

3. **Adding a New Tool**
   - Create a new directory in `/src/tools/[tool_name]`
   - Implement the tool's main component, hooks, and utilities
   - Add a route in `/src/App.tsx` for the new tool
   - Create test files in `/src/tests/tools/[tool_name]`

4. **Coding Standards**
   - Follow the ESLint and Prettier configurations
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Write meaningful comments and use JSDoc for function documentation
   - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility

5. **State Management**
   - Use React Context for global state when necessary
   - Prefer local state and prop drilling for simpler components
   - Utilize React Query for server state management

6. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for individual components and functions
   - Create integration tests for tool-specific workflows
   - Aim for at least 80% test coverage for critical components

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use React.memo for expensive render operations
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading for tools
   - Optimize images and assets for web delivery

8. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Use appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary
   - Maintain a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text

9. **Internationalization**
   - Use the provided i18n setup for adding new translations
   - Avoid hardcoding text strings; use translation keys instead

10. **Pull Request Process**
    - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix
    - Follow the PR template when submitting a pull request
    - Ensure all tests pass and no linting errors are present
    - Request a review from at least one team member

11. **Documentation**
    - Update the README.md file with any new features or changes
    - Maintain up-to-date JSDoc comments for functions and components
    - Create or update user documentation for new tools or major changes

12. **Troubleshooting**
    - Check the project's issue tracker for known issues
    - Use the #dev-support channel in our Slack workspace for questions
    - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` to catch common issues

13. **Deployment**
    - Merges to the main branch will trigger automatic deployment
    - Use environment variables for any environment-specific configurations
    - Test thoroughly in the staging environment before production release
